Resume
======

Best viewed in a maximized browser window. Tested on **Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE10+**. Not compatible with tablets or anything with a small screen, as the UI is optimized for large screens and this particular design cannot be both visually appealing and usable on a screen smaller than a desktop. I can add small screen compatibility, just drop an [issue](https://github.com/eighttrackmind/resume/issues).

*note: at the cost of load time performance, the source is unminified and unconcatenated by design so that it is still readable as embedded source code. if building yourself, use the included `build.js` script with the `require.js` optimizer.*
