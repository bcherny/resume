Resume
======

Best viewed in a maximized browser window. Tested on **Chrome, Firefox, and Safari**. Not compatible with tablets or anything with a small screen, though that is a function of producing this resume on a time constraint. I can add small screen compatibility, just drop an [issue](https://github.com/eighttrackmind/resume/issues).

*note: the source is unminified and unconcatenated by design, so that it is still readable as embedded source code. if building yourself, use the included `build.js` script with the `require.js` optimizer.*
